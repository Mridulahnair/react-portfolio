# My Photography Project

In this article, we will discuss the design philosophies applied to a series of three photographs created for the CS6041 Interactive Media Project. The assignment required capturing three distinct images: a formal headshot, an aesthetic or dramatic shot, and a photograph that reflects a personal passion. Each of these images was designed with specific principles of composition, lighting, and mood in mind, resulting in a cohesive photography series. 

## Design Philosophy of Headshot

In this “professional type headshot” I decided to go with a crossed arm pose with face slightly tilted towards the light to convey confidence and openness making it a well-suited picture for formal use for professional branding on a website for instance.
I used a fixed focal length of 24mm, which isn’t usually the first choice for a headshot, but I opted for it to capture a wider frame and show a bit more movement. I wanted a photo that felt natural and relaxed, while still maintaining a formal tone, rather than a traditional headshot.
The aperture was set to f/1.8 to let in as much light as possible, given that this photo was taken indoors in a low-light setting. The shutter speed used was 1/10s—a slower speed to allow more light to enter. Additionally, I set the ISO to 100 to keep the image sharp and clear, despite the limited lighting


## Design Philosophy of Dramatic shot

In this portrait, I framed the scene with a focus on the play between light and shadows, using my phone's flashlight to create an intense dramatic vibe. I went with a 35 mm focal length to capture more of the scene. I picked an aperture of f/2.5 because I wanted the subject (myself) to be sharp while the background softly blurred out ( further blur was taken care while editing the image. With a shutter speed of 1/15 seconds, I got just the right amount of light in, and keeping the ISO at 160 helped keep the noise down and the photo nice and sharp.

## Design Philosophy of Passion / About me shot

I absolutely love being outdoors with a book in hand. There’s something magical about lying on the grass, where the warmth wraps around me and the scent of nature fills the air—even if I have to wear a jacket because it’s cold here in Ireland. That’s precisely what this photo captures: me in my most comfortable self.
The image was taken with a focal length of 24 mm, which allowed for a wider view, bringing the surrounding grass into the frame and making it easier to connect me with my environment. The aperture was set to f/3.2, keeping my eyes in focus while gently blurring the grass around me, creating a sense of infinity as it expands outwards. I also used a shutter speed of 1/40 seconds, which was ideal for this situation since it ensured enough light entered the frame, even on a cloudy day.
